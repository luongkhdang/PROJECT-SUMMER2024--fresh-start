hoisting: javascript - is a behavior in which variable and function declarations are moved to the top
of their containing scope during the compilation phase. 
	this means that you can use variables and functions before you declare them in your code.
	however, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.


function sum() {
    let total = 0;
    for (let value of arguments)
        total += value;
    return total;
}
