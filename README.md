# Python-summer-2024---fresh-start
ABOUT ME:
      Dedicating the summer 2024 to break back into Tech. BS CompSci at San Francisco State University.
      
      After 3 years (2022-2024) working in sales (Insurance), I have became a better communicator, professional, self-determined and problem-solver.
      
      I've decided that Summer2024 is the time to make a come-back as a software engineer. Software engineering is who I am by heart, and I'm determined to be a great SWE, with the real life     knowledge I've learned in the last 3 years.
      
      
      This summer2024, I will re-adopt the swe mindset, start off fresh from the basic, and ultimately become employable as a full-stack swe.
  
  

PROJECT SUMMER2024:
      This is a collective of small projects to reflect my journey to become a full-stack swe.


CAREER BUILDING - OBJECTIVE:
In the Summer2024, I will:
        Master the coding Python, 
        and build a strong problem solving by practicing Leetcode (using Python+Java).
